# Outline and user stories

The idea is to build a PubQuiz like app where a player can start a quiz, answer the questions and
get's a score. But it would be nice to add a timer, so that the player has to answer within the set
time. Ultimately it would be nice that a host can set up a pub quiz and let others join so that they
can play against each other.

1. Show 1 multiple choice question, answer, see result

2. Start screen, Add timer, set time limit for question

3. Multiple questions

4. Multi-player, host a quiz, let others join

5. Whoever pushes a button first, may answer the question
